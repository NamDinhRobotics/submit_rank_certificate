"""Pin the exact-arithmetic certificate, including where it does NOT certify.

The point of exact arithmetic here is that a sign is either negative or it is
not; a test suite that only asserted the successes would pass just as well for a
routine that certified everything.  So the failures are pinned too: the
single-segment configurations must stay strictly negative, and welded knots must
stay strictly negative, in exact arithmetic.

The other thing worth pinning is that the exact computation answers the same
question as the floating-point pipeline.  It uses a different null-space basis,
and that is only harmless because the tested block is basis-independent --- so
that invariance is asserted directly rather than assumed.
